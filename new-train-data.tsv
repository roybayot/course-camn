1	"@username does heroes of the storm count? #e3 + following some game people = one bajillion tweets per second. @username bringing new meaning to the term ""board member"" @username @username because wool things are more volumetric, and flat/spiky things like leaves/teeth (and road) look better as felt. @username cause you're uninformed? sudan, uganda, cambodia. (genocides) yang xinhai, ramadan mansour, luis garavito. (mass murderers) @username doesn't matter much. plenty of them support it. current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either. @username @username @username it's not about the money. it's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years. no, pc advisor. inkjet printers do not fall under the category of color laser printers... http://t.co/qt1apjcd76 and no, @username. anything that has a sticker saying ""xerox"" is not an hp officejet. nor is the 8100 a laser printer. http://t.co/cysfi4gens @username i'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers. @username he has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature. i really quite like it that red bull will just up and fund stuff like danny macaskill's imaginate: http://t.co/njw81ivzjy via @username @username @username availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. the prominence and promotion of those games is. it sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more. it sucks even more when your pc breaks while looking for a solution. =( @username hurray for dutch sportsball, huh? @username i was on @username and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality! the current @username bundle is worth it just for @username 's fantastic pineapple smash crew. today, fear soaked fabric as over 50 victims suffered a gruesome fate. my wardrobe shrunk from 100cm to only 57cm. (1/3) among the casualties are 6 tops, 18 tees, 10 longsleeves, 8 dress shirts, 5 pants, 6 shorts and a suit. (2/3) just saw fireworks in the #netherlands , wondering if it's for #fifaworldcup #bravscol or some u.s. expats celebrating #independenceday @username man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don't like... you could have spent it on making a ""wtf is?"" video ;) @username but today is not that day!! http://t.co/v0y7dpp3xm @username because its spelled ""götze"" and 'oe' is the internationally accepted spelling when you don't have access to diacritics. @username is this in response to the recent gamasutra article / ftc quote? bought a new pc with windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates. after a day i'm on the verge of a mental breakdown... =( seriously. who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? i don't need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers. @username @username instead you want these. chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. don't know the english name. http://t.co/znqjgxeiav @username yeah i've been looking into similar things, like the stuff from @username. not sure what i end up choosing yet. @username also, w8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh* @username definitely gonna give it a try. seems to be the most feature rich one, and i love the price of free. @username right now? i don't really know. there's no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont) http://t.co/7zmcs94hqm @username pix or it didn't happen. (or linx) @username maybe they're taking the adage ""all publicity is good publicity"" a tad too literal? @username @username heh. i like how they call forbes 'unprofessional'. it's only a century old business magazine, after all. well, #dota2ti4 championship final was a bit of a letdown... very one-sided, almost like the brazil #fifa2014 matches earlier this month. @username how come nl/eu prices for businesses are so skewed? i almost understand $140 -> €140 but there's no way $400 should -> €540($727) statistics! colors! games! graphs! numbers! info! money! jerbs! exclamation marks! http://t.co/hvevxscr9v #gamedev @username ooh. freddie mercury! i loved his music in neverending story as well. but why is that spiderman quote in there? @username your bundle currently costs. ?€ i thought that was funny. @username remember when you mentioned ru-ua-eu war? it's already happening on kickstarter, according to areal! http://t.co/tqbsyc9esc this is a good looking kickstarter! https://t.co/9emxuuund2 love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too) i wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers. @username with you being you, i'm not sure if that's asap or never. how come art software always has such a shitty gui? i'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability. @username will this work with the regular pc forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? would be handy to have that integrated. @username gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. a downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue? @username can hardly wait for pc version x. what i've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work. @username yeah i know they're 2x. i scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. does ingame have normals or something? @username i just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind. @username @username it really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. often i find they add too much powder, too. i... uh... what? dafuq? https://t.co/vt0emjofyn @username don't worry. you will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. http://t.co/c8qaznjw3l @username how are the podcasts rubbish? only thing edited for (the yt version of) that are the commercials, right? @username i get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, i do. but background music from games? and beyond that, do you think that (1/2) @username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=©, too) you generally say that streaming is a transformative art. @username technically, this is a mobile game. and i'm not sure i would call this 'playing'. yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders. https://t.co/wr1elzcrf4 @username no. you'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need. @username ooh. sanchez. i strongly approve of this. @username @username @username i'm in that camp. everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer. @username @username the biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. sports thrive on spectators. (semi)finals get more views. @username @username says it right there ""? the jester race a song by in flames"" @username @username given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt ""slighly off"". (j/k well done zooc) @username lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy. @username i think you're mixing up gone home and dear esther. not many people argued gone home wasn't a game, just not a good one. @username i think you should do a combination. good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned. @username it might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? nope, nope, nope, this looks decent. @username @username @username hurrah! you didn't call it the a/s/l challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name. @username @username heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box... @username and dolla dolla bills yo. (also my shirt) @username @username http://t.co/lrtffdinqj seems kind of relevant in this case too. from several perspectives. @username you're right on the first account. many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of debates is divisive. http://t.co/e4kkt588dh @username what's the crest for that? @username that actually seems interesting data, yeah. i wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that. using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. sorry mr snail... @username liking youtubers isn't a problem either. which leaves ""harassing"" as the only issue. @username threat? or... treat? simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. good on you, germany. http://t.co/w62wy4yiyr @username i know, right. you're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time. @username for me, personally, it's like a tv show. i can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort. @username @username quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.wonder where this will go? @username @username you mean ""asshole"" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? i'm pretty sure that's what you mean. @username @username @username should the flooding work that way? don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out? @username dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness. @username jim, try monster rehab. it's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... i mean sweeteners. @username @username unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay €35 and €70. personally, i just wait for price drops. @username @username and what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play? @username @username it was a hypothetical. hence why he says ""at your own risk"". it might work fine, it might cost you. @username definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. a game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it. @username @username ooh, this is pretty. any info on how it's done? looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach? @username what, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? is this some kind of magic? are you a wizerds? @username @username it is rather uncanny... http://t.co/ezjmuwrts0 just binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. it's gooood. http://t.co/jvoccoc5fp @username @username with 300+ employees, they're well past the 'dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage. didn't know i, a european, could send emails about net neutrality to us gov. europeans unite! http://t.co/ijssklf3rj http://t.co/11mwt6blo7 @username i've always likened dear esther to a book or movie. you can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency. @username personally, i'd love physical media as an option, if it were just that. but most games nowadays are just a dvd + steam code. @username next bundle? http://t.co/oj7iofedwb @username you have your own npc and you're giving out games? conspiracyyy!!!! @username @username @username he's an author at destructoid. he is games media. conrad, thanks for making the distinction."

you too pal!"" could be one of my catch phrases #brooklynborn toll bridge trolls need to eat too. today the paychecks come in, and even though i can't deposit until tomorrow morning, i can't fucking wait!! seems like i should have my #jawboneup back finally!! boo yah! upgrading my room she always calls right when i'm getting ready to leave for work -.- lol, word? aight then. shaken my ass while i hit the bong, cause it makes me feel so damn good there's still some hood rat in me. time to slip on something a little more comfortable and hit the bong. don't need saving, cause there's no salvation for a bad girl 3and a half hours till i can get back to where i wanna be. cabin in the woods. ???? fuck yes to this movie. simply that. fuck yes. #elysium was pretty cool ???? oh my god, i wish i could figure out what i did to my left shoulder/arm, cause it hurts like a motherfucker!! i hate these games.... do what you will. looks like i'll be taking the bus a lot more woke up to some static and stress rewind. think im'a wake up to a bowl instead. @username see, what he had meant to say is ""when a child is bad"" but what he had said is ""when a person is bad"" ey!! neighborhood rules apply!! you ain't seen nuthen, you ain't heard nuthen, you don't know nuthen. #thingsisayatwork over the hills and far away, she prays that he'll return someday. as sure as the river meets the sea, back in his arms he swears she'll be nothing to do for the next hour when you don't even get a goodbye and you don't hear from someone all day << i guess they realized i don't have shit to do either so they sent me home early. right after my bus left. so now i'm waiting 20 minutes for the next bus. wow. fuck you and your bad manners so ready to be home already i'm just blowin in the wind. ready for the worst. well i feel sufficiently stupid. whatever. i'm done bothering for now ???? almost put my stuff i'm the wrong grinder, whoops! lol i'm smirken sooooo hard. fuck that. laughing. this deserves a bowl it's so damn glorious. coughing my ass off, the ""i'm getting high"" alarm is sounding decided to make a coconut pastry cream tart topped with mango, pineapple, papaya, lychee, etc. for mom's birthday ???? sitting here trying to figure out what this all means... i'm just gonna sit here and wish you missed me too... he speaks in terms of centuries. time to get ready for work. made the arrangements for my moms birthday like a responsible adult. still got 40 minutes before the market opens so i can grab the last of what i need just enough time to get high ???? i am in love with this baby pink lipstick i just got yesterday!! ???????????????? retail people love me. when i go into a store i know precisely what i want, exactly what i'm asking for, and i've already decided to buy it. today is my mothers birthday. #queenleo ????#allhailthequeen ???????????????? time to get my ass up and back on track. but first this message from our cannabinoid receptors! whatever so glad to be home and reaching for the bong. i'm so tired, but got so much to do ???? trying to remember who i was ???? fuck yeah new ghost adventures today! ugh. put my favorite lipstick through the wash. still usable though. but really, lesson learned. trust my least favorite manager to fuck up my chances at catching the bus that would have had me home already at least they were teaching me to serve beer and wines today :) ???????? up late. up early. a protein rich breakfast before i smoke a bowl. #getfit my goals have evolved. i don't give a fuck how tired you are, this is where anxiety can take you #insomnia #sleepplease soooo sore and exhausted. i'll just be grateful i'm hereto hit this bong and that i've got this bong to hit. i'm in so much fucking pain. can't decide if i'm gonna just hit the bing and grab on to some sleep, or grab some munching a first i'm leaning toward ""bong"" #truth there's a piggy off my coast of the bed, snuffling for skritches ???? thc, then protein, then get stoned out of my mind #morningswithmcfly increasing my intake. i'm tired of not being enough. new #gac just in time for me to enjoy before i head to work? yes yes yes!!! ugh. can't even right now. it wouldn't even be a big deal if i wasn't so fucking hungry. i can now serve beer, wines and some of our signature cocktails! ???????????????????? started at the bottom but i'm coming up like a beast. i missed my intended early bus, so i hit the bong instead ughhhh my luck <<<< haven't even gotten to work and i desperately need a shower and to wash my clothes already, if that says anything about my day so far... the good thing about having luck like mine is its helped make my outlook this: it's a bummer for the first 30 seconds, then there's not much point in anything but laughing it off and planning the next step. nice karmic turn around though with a free bus ride ???? the stench of red bull dozed on the mat for a good 15 minutes living down the block from the high school means i get to listen to the marching band start fucking up bright and early. ???? had my protein and got started on cleaning the kitchen. it's time for some rips before anything else though. reminds me of you i feel sick right now i'm just gonna hit the bong and forget work 3 hours later than i expected. shazam! damn it's cold in my store. wish i hadn't forgotten my hoodie today -.- god my head is killing me. maybe i should eventually eat something today. i think i put my finger on what's bothering me work in 11 hours ugh, can't figure out why my eyes keep tearing up these past weeks."
