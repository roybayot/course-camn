LINK_HERE and no, @username. anything that has a sticker saying \"xerox\" is not an hp officejet. nor is the 8100 a laser printer. LINK_HERE @username i\\'m really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers. @username he has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature. i really quite like it that red bull will just up and fund stuff like danny macaskill\\'s imaginate: LINK_HERE via @username @username @username availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. the prominence and promotion of those games is. it sucks when your phone suddenly won\\'t read a simcard any more. it sucks even more when your pc breaks while looking for a solution. =( @username hurray for dutch sportsball, huh? @username i was on @username and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality! the current @username bundle is worth it just for @username \\'s fantastic pineapple smash crew. today, fear soaked fabric as over 50 victims suffered a gruesome fate. my wardrobe shrunk from 100cm to only 57cm. (1/3) among the casualties are 6 tops, 18 tees, 10 longsleeves, 8 dress shirts, 5 pants, 6 shorts and a suit. (2/3) just saw fireworks in the HASHTAG_HERE , wondering if it\\'s for HASHTAG_HERE HASHTAG_HERE or some u.s. expats celebrating HASHTAG_HERE @username man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don\\'t like... you could have spent it on making a \"wtf is?\" video ;) @username but today is not that day!! LINK_HERE @username because its spelled \"g\\xf6tze\" and \\'oe\\' is the internationally accepted spelling when you don\\'t have access to diacritics. @username is this in response to the recent gamasutra article / ftc quote? bought a new pc with windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn\\'t be so bad now with the updates. after a day i\\'m on the verge of a mental breakdown... =( seriously. who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? i don\\'t need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers. @username @username instead you want these. chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. don\\'t know the english name. LINK_HERE @username yeah i\\'ve been looking into similar things, like the stuff from @username. not sure what i end up choosing yet. @username also, w8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh* @username definitely gonna give it a try. seems to be the most feature rich one, and i love the price of free. @username right now? i don\\'t really know. there\\'s no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont) LINK_HERE @username pix or it didn\\'t happen. (or linx) @username maybe they\\'re taking the adage \"all publicity is good publicity\" a tad too literal? @username @username heh. i like how they call forbes \\'unprofessional\\'. it\\'s only a century old business magazine, after all. well, HASHTAG_HERE championship final was a bit of a letdown... very one-sided, almost like the brazil HASHTAG_HERE matches earlier this month. @username how come nl/eu prices for businesses are so skewed? i almost understand $140 -> \\u20ac140 but there\\'s no way $400 should -> \\u20ac540($727) statistics! colors! games! graphs! numbers! info! money! jerbs! exclamation marks! LINK_HERE HASHTAG_HERE @username ooh. freddie mercury! i loved his music in neverending story as well. but why is that spiderman quote in there? @username your bundle currently costs. ?\\u20ac i thought that was funny. @username remember when you mentioned ru-ua-eu war? it\\'s already happening on kickstarter, according to areal! LINK_HERE this is a good looking kickstarter! LINK_HERE love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too) i wouldn\\'t hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers. @username with you being you, i\\'m not sure if that\\'s asap or never. how come art software always has such a shitty gui? i\\'d assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability. @username will this work with the regular pc forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? would be handy to have that integrated. @username gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. a downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue? @username can hardly wait for pc version x. what i\\'ve gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work. @username yeah i know they\\'re 2x. i scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. does ingame have normals or something? @username i just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind. @username @username it really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. often i find they add too much powder, too. i... uh... what? dafuq? LINK_HERE @username don\\'t worry. you will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. LINK_HERE @username how are the podcasts rubbish? only thing edited for (the yt version of) that are the commercials, right? @username i get the removal of streamed \\'regular\\' music, i do. but background music from games? and beyond that, do you think that (1/2) @username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=\\xa9, too) you generally say that streaming is a transformative art. @username technically, this is a mobile game. and i\\'m not sure i would call this \\'playing\\'. yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders. LINK_HERE @username no. you\\'d be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need. @username ooh. sanchez. i strongly approve of this. @username @username @username i\\'m in that camp. everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer. @username @username the biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. sports thrive on spectators.

(j/k well done zooc) @username lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy. @username i think you\\'re mixing up gone home and dear esther. not many people argued gone home wasn\\'t a game, just not a good one. @username i think you should do a combination. good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned. @username it might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? nope, nope, nope, this looks decent. @username @username @username hurrah! you didn\\'t call it the a/s/l challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity\\'s name. @username @username heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box... @username and dolla dolla bills yo. (also my shirt) @username @username LINK_HERE seems kind of relevant in this case too. from several perspectives. @username you\\'re right on the first account. many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of debates is divisive. LINK_HERE @username what\\'s the crest for that? @username that actually seems interesting data, yeah. i wonder if there\\'s some kind of metrics script for that. using your phone can be dangerous even if you\\'re not driving. sorry mr snail... @username liking youtubers isn\\'t a problem either. which leaves \"harassing\" as the only issue. @username threat? or... treat? simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. good on you, germany. LINK_HERE @username i know, right. you\\'re actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time. @username for me, personally, it\\'s like a tv show. i can relax to it because it\\'s more passive than articles, yet is not supershort. @username @username quite an innovative new \\'exclusive\\' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.wonder where this will go? @username @username you mean \"asshole\" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? i\\'m pretty sure that\\'s what you mean. @username @username @username should the flooding work that way? don\\'t you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out? @username dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness. @username jim, try monster rehab. it\\'s not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn\\'t taste like deat-... i mean sweeteners. @username @username unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay \\u20ac35 and \\u20ac70. personally, i just wait for price drops. @username @username and what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play? @username @username it was a hypothetical. hence why he says \"at your own risk\". it might work fine, it might cost you. @username definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. a game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it. @username @username ooh, this is pretty. any info on how it\\'s done? looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach? @username what, you\\'re able to not hate someone you disagree with? is this some kind of magic? are you a wizerds? @username @username it is rather uncanny... LINK_HERE just binge-read the entirety of @username\\'s comic. it\\'s gooood. LINK_HERE @username @username with 300+ employees, they\\'re well past the \\'dunbar number\\'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage. didn\\'t know i, a european, could send emails about net neutrality to us gov. europeans unite! LINK_HERE LINK_HERE @username i\\'ve always likened dear esther to a book or movie. you can press play/pause, but you don\\'t really have any agency. @username personally, i\\'d love physical media as an option, if it were just that. but most games nowadays are just a dvd + steam code. @username next bundle? LINK_HERE @username you have your own npc and you\\'re giving out games? conspiracyyy!!!! @username @username @username he\\'s an author at destructoid. he is games media. conrad, thanks for making the distinction.',\n",
